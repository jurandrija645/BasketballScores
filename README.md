# 🏀 Basketball Scores

Welcome to **Basketball Scores**, a simple app that lets you keep track of your favorite basketball games right right.
It is meant to be used on the court when you are playing with your friends on a casual sunday afternoon 😊
 This app is something that I always wanted as a kid to avoid all the bickering on the court 😅

## 🚀 What Does It Do?

 This app allows you to:
- **Score Big!**: Add 1, 2, or 3 points for the Home or Away team with just a click. It’s as satisfying as a three-pointer at the buzzer!
- **Beat the Clock**: Watch the timer count down from 12:00 minutes—the length of an NBA quarter.
- **Game Over!**: Get an alert when the timer runs out and know exactly when the quarter ends. No need to keep an eye on the clock constantly!

## 🎉 Features

- **Simple & Intuitive UI**: Easy buttons to add points make scoring a breeze.
- **Real-time Countdown**: A live timer that recreates the feel of a real NBA quarter.
- **Responsive Updates**: See the score change instantly as you update it. Fast, fun, and interactive!
