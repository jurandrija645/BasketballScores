# 🏀 Basketball Scores

Welcome to **Basketball Scores**, a simple app that lets you keep track of your favorite basketball games.
It is meant to be used on the court when you are playing with your friends on a casual sunday afternoon 😊
This app is something that I always wanted as a kid to avoid all the bickering on the court 😅

## 🚀 What Does It Do?

 This app allows you to:
- **Score Big!**: Add 1, 2, or 3 points for the Home or Away team with just a click. It’s as satisfying as a three-pointer at the buzzer!
- **Beat the Clock**: Watch the timer count down from 12:00 minutes—the length of an NBA quarter.
- **Game Over!**: Get an alert when the timer runs out and know exactly when the quarter ends. No need to keep an eye on the clock constantly!

## 🎉 Features

- **Simple & Intuitive UI**: Easy buttons to add points make scoring a breeze.
- **Real-time Countdown**: A live timer that recreates the feel of a real NBA quarter.
- **Responsive Updates**: See the score change instantly as you update it. Fast, fun, and interactive!

## Why This Project?
This project was created as a fun exercise to combine UI interactions with basic timer functionality. It isn’t a revolutionary piece of software, but it serves as a practical demonstration of handling events and state in JavaScript. It’s also a nice little tool for anyone who wants to simulate or keep track of scores without needing a full scoreboard setup.
